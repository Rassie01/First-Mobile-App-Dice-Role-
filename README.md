# Dice Roller App

## My First Flutter Project

Welcome to my first Flutter project! This simple app demonstrates a dice roller with a gradient background. As a beginner in Flutter development, I've created this project to learn and practice the basics.

### Project Description

This app features:
- A gradient background
- A dice image that changes when rolled
- A button to roll the dice

### Files in the Project

1. `main.dart`: The entry point of the application.
2. `gradient_container.dart`: Defines the gradient background of the app.
3. `dice_roller.dart`: Contains the logic for rolling the dice and updating the UI.
4. `styled_text.dart`: A custom text widget (currently unused in the main app).

### How It Works

When you open the app, you'll see a dice image on a gradient background. Tapping the "Roll Dice" button generates a random number between 1 and 6, updating the dice image accordingly.

### Learning Experience

As this is my first Flutter project, there might be areas for improvement or optimization. I'm open to feedback and suggestions for enhancing the code or implementing best practices.

### Running the Project

To run this project:
1. Ensure you have Flutter installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
4. Use `flutter run` to launch the app on your preferred device or emulator.

### Next Steps

I plan to continue learning Flutter and improving this project. Some ideas for future enhancements include:
- Adding animations to the dice roll
- Implementing a score counter
- Creating a more complex game using the dice roll mechanism

### Feedback

As a beginner, I appreciate any constructive feedback or suggestions. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you have ideas for improvements!

Thank you for checking out my first Flutter project!
